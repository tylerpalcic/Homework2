# Description
This application has an analog and digital clock face. The seconds, minutes, hours, month and date can be change by the
various widgets contained within the UI. There is a new clock button that creates another instance of the clocks. Whatever 
changes are made to the information on the clocks take effect to all instances of the clocks, not just the specific one 
changed.
